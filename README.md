Options Pricing model in OCaml for CS 3110 Spring 2022. 

# Overview: 

Quantitative finance is - in essence - 
the art of applying mathematical models to financial markets. Jane Street (one of the world’s 
leading trading firms) is known to be the only trading firm to use OCaml and they have not only 
provided numerous open source projects but have also released specific information about how to use 
OCaml in the trading industry that we have taken inspiration from. Further, Cornell PhD Yaron Minsky 
has written numerous articles such as using OCaml in the financial industry that Cornell Quant Fund will 
use to leverage OCaml’s power to become the world’s second trading organization to utilize OCaml.
